# Analysis
## Background
Computer science as a taught subject in schools has been increasing in prevelance. One of the most commonly used languages that is taught to beginners is Python. This is likely due to its easily-understandable syntax and powerful range of libraries. There are multiple projects that provide beginners with a guide to programming. One notable example is Codecademy. However, while useful for briefly getting people up to speed with syntax, it is somewhat prescriptive and limiting in both the exercises set, and the feedback given. Therefore, tasks and homeworks in computer science are often given as specified problems, with a few examples of test data. Students then submit their work directly to the teacher.

However, this provides the teacher with the challenge of marking the individual pieces of work. Not only is it inefficient to load each program by hand and manually enter test data, but it is also potentially a security risk as code is often run on the host system, rather than in a virtualised environment.

This project aims to fill the gap between the prescriptive teaching of codecademy and the hand marking done by teachers. This will be done by providing an automated process to mark, test and run student code.
