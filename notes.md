# Notes

Be able to hanle different function names from that specified
	How does this handle that?

Simulating users for GUIs (testing non-text input)
	Issue with this is again the same

The thing to think about would be how flexible the system would be



Gamified method of marking scripts
	Get all other to mark each piece of work
	This allows a form of data analysis as to how 'accurate' or trustworthy that each
		person taking part is
	Would also allow for human override


Maybe have a text box with a high level walkthrough of how the code works


Maybe a synthesis of the two
	Maybe a version of codeacademy in which you can only move on after you've reviewed a few other people's pieces of work

Check out some method of plagarising of code
	but bear in mind that there would be similarity between simple problems

	there could be one merit in customising questions for each pupil

Maybe look at a nudge based system which would provide prompts while they're working through - think plugin for text editor


Easy to configure
	Effort for generating task - minimal
	Classroom integration?
	Or web hosted

Another aspect to think about would be the efficiency of the code
	Can we detect recursive algos?
	Another we measure the runtime of the algorithm?

Another issue is the way in which the python scripts are written, i.e there has to be no form of interactive input. The script will also have to be based heavily on functions (this may or may not be a good thing).
